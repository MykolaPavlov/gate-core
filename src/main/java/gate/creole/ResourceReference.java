/**
 * This class provides a common way of referencing a resource regardless of
 * where it is located. Specifically it allows resources stored within plugins
 * to be referenced without needing to know where the resource is actually
 * located as that information is determined when the resource is accessed.
 * Previously most GATE components used {@link java.net.URL URL} instances to
 * refer to resources and to aid in converting existing code to use
 * {@code ResourceReference} instead the public API follows that of {@code URL}
 * where possible.
